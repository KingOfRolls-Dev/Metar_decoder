# 🔐 Security Policy  
This document outlines how security-related issues should be reported for the **METAR Decoder** application.

---

## 🧩 Supported Versions

Because this project distributes only a compiled Windows installer and updates are released manually, the latest version is the only one supported.

| Version | Supported |
|--------|-----------|
| v1.0.0 & Above | ✔️ Yes — actively supported |
| < 1.0  | ❌ No — unsupported |

Only the most recent release receives fixes, improvements, and security attention.

## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, vulnerability, or behavior that could compromise users:

1. **Do NOT open a public issue.**  
2. Email the maintainer directly at:  
   **dev.kingofrolls@gmail.com**
3. Provide:  
   - A clear description of the vulnerability  
   - Steps to reproduce  
   - Your Windows version  
   - Screenshots or logs if applicable  

You can expect a response within **7 days**, and resolution status will be communicated privately until a fix or updated release is ready.

## ⚠️ Scope of Security Concerns

Valid security-related concerns include:

- Behavior that could compromise user data  
- Installation exploits  
- Unexpected system-level access  
- Malware false positives that may indicate packaging issues  
- Integrity or tampering concerns with the installer  

Non-security bugs (UI, decoding errors, crashes, etc.) should be submitted through the **Bug Reports** issue template or discussion thread.
